The input_sounding file (already in appropriate case directories) can be any set of 
levels that goes at least up to the model top height (ztop) in the namelist. The 
first line includes the surface pressure (hPa), potential temperature (K) and moisture
mixing ratio (g/kg).  Each subsequent line has five input values: height (meters above 
sea-level), dry potential temperature (K), vapor mixing ratio (g/kg), x-direction wind 
component (m/s), and y-direction wind component (m/s).  The “ideal.exe” program 
interpolates the data from the input_sounding file and will extrapolate if not enough 
data is provided.
